# retroinsecurity
Case study on insecurity of retro gaming consoles and software.  Primary goal is to point out mistakes in security that lead to either loss of IP (i.e., extraction of ROMs) or ability to modify IP (e.g., manipulating ROMs).  Secondary goal is to highlight areas where open-source licensing restrictions may have been violated.
